      {% include "violation-radio.html", label: "Monopoly", id: "monopoly" %}
      <p>Your company, a competitor, or a company you interact with is trying to create or maintain a monopoly. If a firm is seeking or maintaining monopoly power, it can harm society by lowering output, raising prices, and decreasing innovation than if it had to compete in the market.</p>

      {% include "violation-radio.html", label: "Price fixing", id: "price-fixing" %}
      <p>Price fixing or wage fixing is an agreement among competitors to raise, fix, or otherwise maintain the price at which their goods or services are sold or wages are set.</p>

      {% include "violation-radio.html", label: "Bid rigging", id: "bid-rigging" %}
      <p>Bid rigging is the way that conspiring competitors effectively raise prices where purchasers – often federal, state, or local governments – acquire goods or services by soliciting competing bids.</p>

      {% include "violation-radio.html", label: "Customer or territorial allocation", id: "allocation" %}
      <p>You are concerned that a company divided up customers or the market for its products or services. Market division or allocation schemes are agreements in which competitors divide markets among themselves.</p>

      {% include "violation-radio.html", label: "Anticompetitive employment agreement", id: "noncompete" %}
      <p>You believe an employment agreement is anticompetitive because it contains a no-poach, a non-compete, a non-disclosure, non-solicit agreement, or another covenant that is unlawful. Unsure what this means? <!-- TODO link? --><a href="#" class="usa-link">Learn more about anticompetitive employment agreements</a>.</p>

      {% include "violation-radio.html", label: "Mergers", id: "mergers" %}
      <p>The Division investigates mergers that may substantially lessen competition. For example, "gun jumping," where merging parties that are awaiting regulatory approval for their transaction begin to engage in pre-merger coordination such as merging their operations or otherwise transferring significant operational, management, or decision making control over the to-be-acquired assets.</p>
