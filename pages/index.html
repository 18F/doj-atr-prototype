    What is an antitrust violation?
  </h2>
  <p>Many types of activities can violate antitrust laws. These include:</p>

  <div class="usa-accordion usa-accordion--multiselectable" data-allow-multiple>
    <h3 class="usa-accordion__heading">
      <button
        type="button"
        class="usa-accordion__button"
        aria-expanded="true"
        aria-controls="m-a1"
      >
        Creating or maintaining a monopoly
      </button>
    </h3>
    <div id="m-a1" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
      <p>An unlawful monopoly exists when one firm has gotten or maintained market power for a product or service by <em>intentionally acting to prevent competition</em>.</p>

      <p>Such monopolies can lower output, raise prices, and reduce innovation.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="usa-accordion__heading">
      <button
        type="button"
        class="usa-accordion__button"
        aria-expanded="false"
        aria-controls="m-a2"
      >
        Price fixing
      </button>
    </h3>
    <div id="m-a2" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
      <p>Price fixing occurs when competitors agree to raise, fix, or otherwise maintain the price for their products or services. For example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Set or adhere to price discounts</li>
        <li>Keep prices the same</li>
        <li>Get rid of or lower discounts</li>
        <li>Use the same formula to set prices</li>
        <li>Maintain a certain difference in price for different types, sizes, or quantities of products</li>
        <li>Adhere to a minimum fee or price schedule</li>
        <li>Fix credit terms</li>
        <li>Doesn’t advertise prices</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Price fixing restricts price competition and harms consumers.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="usa-accordion__heading">
      <button
        type="button"

        aria-controls="m-a3"
      >
        Wage fixing
      </button>
    </h3>
    <div id="m-a3" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
      <p>Wage fixing occurs when competitors agree to fix or otherwise maintain wages for employees in the same market.</p>

      <p>Wage fixing deprives workers of better compensation and an open labor market.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="usa-accordion__heading">
      <button

      >
        Bid rigging
      </button>
    </h3>
    <div id="m-a4" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
      <p>Bid rigging occurs when parties in a competitive bidding process agree <em>before they submit their bids</em> to the buyer who will “win” the contract.</p>

      <p>Often, the buyer is a federal, state, or local government. Bid rigging artificially raises prices.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="usa-accordion__heading">

      >
        Market division
      </button>
    </h3>
    <div id="m-a5" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
      <p>Market division or allocation schemes occur when companies agree to divvy up a market for its products or services, such as by customer territory.</p>

      <p>Such schemes limit consumer options for a good or service.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="usa-accordion__heading">
      <button
        type="button"

      >
        Unlawful employment agreements
      </button>
    </h3>
    <div id="m-a6" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
      <p>Unlawful employment agreements can take many forms:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A no-poach agreement exists when competitors agree not to hire, recruit, or pursue each other's employees.</li>
        <li>A non-compete agreement is a covenant in an employment contract that limits a worker who leaves the employer from being able to join or start a competing firm.</li>
        <li>A non-disclosure agreement limits a worker’s ability to share or make use of trade secrets or other proprietary information.</li>
        <li>A non-solicit agreement exists when a company agrees with another company to refuse to solicit or hire each other’s employees.</li>
        <li>Training repayment agreements require a worker to repay the firm if they leave before a specified date.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Such agreements harm workers and innovation.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="usa-accordion__heading">

        Company mergers
      </button>
    </h3>
    <div id="m-a7" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
      <p>A company merger or acquisition can significantly limit competition in a market for a particular good or service, and/or harm workers.</p>
