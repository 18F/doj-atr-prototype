    What is an antitrust violation?
  </h2>
  <p>The antitrust laws aim to protect economic freedom and opportunity. They do so by promoting free and fair competition for goods, services, and labor.</p>
  <p>Free and fair competition has many benefits, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lower prices, better quality, and more choice of goods and services</li>
    <li>Higher wages</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The antitrust laws promote competition by prohibiting activities like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Price fixing</li>
    <li>Corporate mergers likely to lower competition within a particular market</li>
    <li>Acts meant to gain or keep monopoly power</li>
  </ul>

    How does the Antitrust Division handle antitrust complaints?
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Antitrust Division will create a record of the information that you provided, review your complaint, and refer it to the appropriate Division staff for further review. If the Division needs more information, we will contact you. Due to the confidential nature of Division investigations, you will not be notified if we open an investigation. While we try to reply to every complaint, we cannot always respond to each message individually.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our <a href="#">Confidentiality Policy</a> and <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a> apply to all complaints received by the Antitrust Division.
